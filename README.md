# ML Lab3
## Problem description

The aim of this lab is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Video Game Sales dataset. The objective is to understand the dataset structure, analyze sales patterns, detect missing values, and explore relationships between different features. This step helps prepare the data for future machine learning tasks.

## DataSet
